# 🌌 Project Neon

A chaotic little 2D platformer built from scratch by me and a few friends during our first adventure into game dev.

## 🐛 Known Issues

> We like to say it’s “speedrun-friendly,” but really... it’s just buggy (in a fun way).  
> This was our first game ever, so yeah — the scuffedness is intentional. Kind of.

- Collision bugs? Yes.  
- Janky physics? Of course.  
- Infinite jumping? Probably.  
- Fun anyway? Absolutely.

## 💬 Notes

This was our first full game dev project, and we poured a ton of love (and bugs) into it.  
If you give it a shot, thank you. If you speedrun it, we love you.
